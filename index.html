                Hi there! So, I'm a 38 year old bar manager.  Let me take you through exactly how that came to be. 
                I was on my way to attend class at the University of Utah on a fine and lovely September morning in 2007,
                when I was struck by an automobile whilst attempting to traverse a cross-walk near campus.  The car was 
                going FAST, so I was understandably pretty beat up (lots of broken stuff, hardware being implanted, etc -
                no need for the gory details).  The rest is sort of history, as the medical debt I incurred for all the 
                surgeries I required forced me from school and into two jobs instead.  Well, it took a lot of years but 
                here I am in this course attempting to adjust-course (no pun intended there), and perhaps find a way OUT 
                of the bar industry which has consumed and owned me for the last 20 years or so.  Feeling optimistic.
